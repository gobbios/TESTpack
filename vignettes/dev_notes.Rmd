If the package does contain pdf vignettes CRAN seems to complain if these files were not compressed.
So here is a file with a figure.

When building the source package, either use 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::build(args = c('--compact-vignettes=both'))
```


The following seems not to work... !!!

Alternatively, add '--compact-vignettes=both' to the build options in the package options of the package's RStudio project.


```{r}
plot(rnorm(1000), rnorm(1000))
```
